## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I realized how challenging it can be to create a layout that works well on both mobile and desktop. When I switched to the desktop view, I often found myself needing extra wrappers or containers to style sections properly and keep everything consistent.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on refining details in future projects. For example, I really struggled with the desktop version of footer in this challenge — I built it in a rather complicated way and still haven’t fully finished it. I plan to look at other people’s solutions to understand how to do it. Also I will try something with JS.
